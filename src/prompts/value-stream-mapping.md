# Lean Value Stream Mapping Training Prompt

Create a comprehensive {{duration}}-minute **Value Stream Mapping** training presentation for {{level}} level students in the {{industry}} industry.

## CORE LEAN FOCUS
This training MUST be grounded in **Value Stream Mapping as a lean analysis tool**:
- **VSM is the foundation** of lean transformation planning
- Emphasize **seeing the whole** vs. individual processes  
- Connect to **waste identification** and **flow improvement**
- Focus on **current state → future state → action plan**
- Use **lean terminology** and **customer value perspective**

## VALUE STREAM MAPPING METHODOLOGY - CORE CONTENT

### Current State Mapping
- **Material Flow**: Physical movement of products/services
- **Information Flow**: Communication and decision points
- **Timeline**: Processing time vs. lead time analysis
- **Data Collection**: Cycle times, changeovers, defects, uptime
- **{{industry}} examples**: Specific to industry value streams

### Value Stream Analysis
- **Value-Added vs. Non-Value-Added** time calculation
- **Lead Time Analysis**: Total time from order to delivery
- **Process Cycle Efficiency**: VA time / Total time
- **Waste Identification**: 8 wastes within the value stream
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Constraint identification

### Future State Design
- **Flow Improvement**: Eliminating stops and delays
- **Pull System Integration**: Kanban and pull signals
- **Level Loading**: Balancing production with demand
- **Quality at Source**: Error-proofing integration
- **{{industry}} applications**: Industry-specific improvements

## INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ({{industry}})
{{#if_industry_food}}
**FOOD INDUSTRY VSM FOCUS:**
- **Farm to table** value stream mapping
- **Food safety checkpoints** as value-adding steps
- **Cold chain management** and temperature control
- **Shelf life** and **FIFO inventory** considerations
- **Regulatory compliance** timeline impacts

{{#if_industry_manufacturing}}
**MANUFACTURING VSM FOCUS:**
- **Supplier to customer** complete value stream
- **Production flow** and **machine changeovers**
- **Quality control** integration points
- **Maintenance schedules** impact on flow
- **Supply chain** and **logistics** optimization
{{/if_industry_manufacturing}}

{{#if_industry_healthcare}}
**HEALTHCARE VSM FOCUS:**
- **Patient journey** from admission to discharge
- **Information flow** and **handoff points**
- **Wait times** and **patient safety**
- **Resource utilization** and **staff workflow**
- **Regulatory documentation** requirements
{{/if_industry_healthcare}}

## VSM SYMBOLS AND NOTATION
- **Process boxes**: Value-adding activities
- **Data boxes**: Cycle time, changeover, uptime
- **Inventory triangles**: WIP and finished goods
- **Information flows**: Schedules and communications
- **Timeline**: Lead time and processing time

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
- **Week 1-2**: Current state mapping and data collection
- **Week 3**: Current state analysis and waste identification
- **Week 4**: Future state design with lean principles
- **Week 5-6**: Action plan development and implementation
- **Ongoing**: Monitoring and continuous improvement

## INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS
- **Hands-on mapping exercise**: Create VSM for sample process
- **{{industry}} case study**: Before/after VSM example
- **Data analysis workshop**: Calculate cycle efficiency
- **Action planning session**: Prioritize improvement opportunities

## LEVEL-SPECIFIC APPROACH
{{#if_level_beginner}}
**BEGINNER APPROACH:**
- Start with **simple value stream** example
- Focus on **basic symbols** and **mapping mechanics**
- Emphasize **seeing waste** and **customer perspective**
- Provide **step-by-step** mapping process
- Use **templates** and **guided exercises**
{{/if_level_beginner}}

{{#if_level_intermediate}}
**INTERMEDIATE APPROACH:**
- Complex **multi-product value streams**
- **Advanced analysis techniques** and **metrics**
- **Information flow** complexity and **decision points**
- **Future state design** principles and **implementation**
- **Change management** for VSM improvements
{{/if_level_intermediate}}

{{#if_level_advanced}}
**ADVANCED APPROACH:**
- **Enterprise-level** value stream mapping
- **Cross-functional** and **multi-site** value streams
- **Strategic alignment** with **business objectives**
- **VSM integration** with other **lean tools**
- **Leading VSM initiatives** and **coaching others**
{{/if_level_advanced}}

## SUCCESS METRICS
- **Lead Time Reduction**: Faster customer delivery
- **Process Cycle Efficiency**: Higher value-added ratio
- **Inventory Reduction**: Less work-in-process
- **Quality Improvement**: Defect reduction
- **Employee Engagement**: Better understanding of value

This training should demonstrate **VSM as the roadmap to lean transformation** and **systematic waste elimination**.
