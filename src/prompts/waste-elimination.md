# Lean Waste Elimination Training Prompt

Create a comprehensive {{duration}}-minute **Lean Waste Elimination** training presentation for {{level}} level students in the {{industry}} industry.

## CORE LEAN FOCUS
This training MUST be grounded in **Lean Manufacturing/Lean Methodology** principles:
- Focus on the **8 Types of Waste (MUDA)** in lean thinking
- Emphasize **Value Stream Thinking** - what adds value vs. what doesn't
- Apply **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)** mindset
- Use **lean terminology** and proven lean tools
- Connect everything back to **customer value** and **operational excellence**

## THE 8 WASTES (MUDA) - CORE CONTENT
Ensure the presentation covers all 8 wastes with {{industry}}-specific examples:

1. **Transportation** - Unnecessary movement of materials/products
2. **Inventory** - Excess raw materials, WIP, or finished goods  
3. **Motion** - Unnecessary movement of people
4. **Waiting** - Idle time when resources aren't being utilized
5. **Overproduction** - Making more than customer demand
6. **Over-processing** - Doing more work than customer values
7. **Defects** - Errors, rework, scrap, corrections
8. **Skills/Talent** - Underutilizing people's abilities

## INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ({{industry}})
{{#if_industry_food}}
**FOOD INDUSTRY WASTE EXAMPLES:**
- **Transportation**: Moving ingredients unnecessarily between processing stations
- **Inventory**: Excess perishable inventory leading to spoilage and waste
- **Motion**: Workers walking excessive distances in production areas
- **Waiting**: Equipment downtime during changeovers, waiting for quality approvals
- **Overproduction**: Making more product than customer orders (especially perishables)
- **Over-processing**: Excessive quality checks, over-packaging
- **Defects**: Food safety issues, contamination, product recalls
- **Skills**: Not utilizing workers' improvement ideas, cross-training opportunities

**FOOD INDUSTRY LEAN TOOLS:**
- HACCP integration with lean principles
- First In, First Out (FIFO) for inventory management
- Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) for equipment changeovers
- Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) to reduce equipment downtime
- Poka-yoke (error-proofing) for food safety
