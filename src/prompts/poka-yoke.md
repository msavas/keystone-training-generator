# Lean Poka-Yoke Training Prompt

Create a comprehensive {{duration}}-minute **Poka-Yoke (Error-Proofing)** training presentation for {{level}} level students in the {{industry}} industry.

## CORE LEAN FOCUS
This training MUST be grounded in **Poka-Yoke as quality at the source**:
- **Prevent defects** before they occur rather than **detecting** them
- **Human error** is inevitable, **systems must prevent** mistakes
- **Simple, low-cost solutions** that **eliminate error potential**
- **Quality built into** the **process**, not **inspected in**
- **Zero defects** through **mistake-proofing design**

## POKA-YOKE METHODOLOGY - CORE CONTENT

### Definition and Philosophy
- **Poka-Yoke**: Japanese term meaning "mistake-proofing" or "error-proofing"
- **Shigeo Shingo**: Pioneer of mistake-proofing methodology
- **Zero Quality Control**: Defects eliminated at source, not detected later
- **Respect for people**: Systems prevent human error, don't blame workers
- **{{industry}} relevance**: Why error-proofing matters in this industry

### Types of Human Errors
#### Inadvertent Errors (Mistakes)
- **Forgetfulness**: Forgetting steps or requirements
- **Misunderstanding**: Incorrect interpretation of instructions
- **Identification errors**: Confusing similar items or information
- **Inexperience**: Lack of knowledge or skill

#### Intentional Errors (Rule Violations)
- **Willful disregard**: Ignoring known procedures
- **Shortcuts**: Bypassing standard methods
- **Risk-taking**: Accepting unnecessary risks
- **Complacency**: Overconfidence in abilities

### Poka-Yoke Detection Methods
#### Contact Method
- **Physical contact**: Shape, size, or dimension checking
- **Automatic detection**: Physical mismatch prevents continuation
- **{{industry}} examples**: Connectors, fixtures, templates

#### Fixed-Value Method
- **Counting**: Specific quantities or numbers required
- **Completeness checking**: All required elements present
- **{{industry}} examples**: Parts counting, step verification

#### Motion-Step Method
- **Sequence verification**: Correct order of operations
- **Movement confirmation**: Required actions completed
- **{{industry}} examples**: Process step completion, safety procedures

### Poka-Yoke Action Methods
#### Warning Method
- **Alert signals**: Visual, audio, or tactile warnings
- **Attention getting**: Operator notified of potential error
- **Continued operation**: Process can continue with caution
- **Examples**: Lights, buzzers, alarms, displays

#### Control Method
- **Process stopping**: Automatic shutdown when error detected
- **Prevention**: Error cannot occur or continue
- **Forced correction**: Problem must be resolved to proceed
- **Examples**: Interlocks, shutoffs, blocking devices

## DEVELOPING POKA-YOKE SOLUTIONS

### Step 1: Error Identification and Analysis
- **Defect analysis**: What errors occur and why
- **Root cause investigation**: Human factors contributing to errors
- **Error frequency**: How often problems happen
- **Error impact**: Consequences of mistakes

### Step 2: Error Prevention Strategy
- **Elimination**: Remove opportunity for error completely
- **Replacement**: Substitute error-prone process with safer alternative
- **Prevention**: Make error impossible through design
- **Detection**: Catch errors before they propagate

### Step 3: Solution Design and Implementation
- **Simple mechanisms**: Low-cost, effective solutions
- **Fail-safe design**: System defaults to safe condition
- **User-friendly**: Easy to understand and use
- **Maintenance-free**: Reliable operation without constant attention

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- **Prototype testing**: Verify effectiveness under real conditions
- **User feedback**: Operator input and suggestions
- **Performance measurement**: Error reduction quantification
- **Continuous improvement**: Refinement based on experience

## POKA-YOKE EXAMPLES AND CATEGORIES
